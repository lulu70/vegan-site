instructions:
  - items:
      - Mix the yeast with half a cup room temperature water in a glass.
      - Place the flour, the yeast, the sugar, and the oil into a bowl, (if you have a standing mixer you can place it in the working bowl) and knead for five minutes.
      - Add the salt and knead until you get a beautiful non-sticky stable piece of dough, add the other half a cup of water gradually and carefully.
      - Place a cloth or a towel on top of the bowl and let it rest for an hour.
      - Take the dough out of the bowl, place onto a floured workspace, and form a long round shape (like a shape of a normal loaf of bread).
      - Cut eight even pieces and form each piece into a small round ball with a smooth top, pulling dough from the sides and tucking the ends underneath the bottom.
      - Place a cloth or a towel on top of the balls and let them rest for 15 minutes.
      - On a floured workspace gently pat each ball flat using your hand and form a round pita shape using a rolling pin - the thickness should be around 6 mm (¼ inch).
      - Preheat the oven to 250℃.
      - Prepare a baking tray with baking paper, sprinkle some flour on it, and place the pitas on.
      - Bake for about 5 minutes until there is a bit of a color change.
      - Take out, let it chill a few minutes.

## The home made pita

Easy and authentic home made pita bread recipe, requires a few basic ingredients for success.
If you asking yourself: is it worth the effort ? **Yes it does,** the result will be fresh and super tasty, so much better then what you can usually buy in a normal grocery store.

## What is pita bread?

**A pita bread is a round flatbread, normally baked from wheat flour and normally has an interior pocket.**
Because of the pocket shape, it can be (and most commonly) used to craft a sandwich, you crack it open, stuff whatever you feel like inside, and you've got a neat, portable, and easy to eat sandwich.
Check out <Link to="/recipes/home-made-falafel">our home made falafel</Link> for the ultimate pita sandwich idea.
The sandwich, the most common use of this bread is not the only option though, many pita lovers also love to use it in a less constructed way, they just tear of a piece of it and dip it in a dip like <Link to="/recipes/the-ultimate-hummus-protein-bomb">hummus</Link> or a sauce like <Link to="/recipes/green-chili-sauce">our green chili sauce</Link> or even a soup.
It doesn't matter how you use it, there are no rules, the fresh pita bread is simple, tasty, and a bread option which is normally without a doubt VEGAN.
