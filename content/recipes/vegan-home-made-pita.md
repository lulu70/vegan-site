## The home made pita

Easy and authentic home made pita bread recipe, requires a few basic ingredients for success.
If you asking yourself: is it worth the effort ? **Yes it does,** the result will be fresh and super tasty, so much better then what you can usually buy in a normal grocery store.

## What is pita bread?

**A pita bread is a round flatbread, normally baked from wheat flour and normally has an interior pocket.**
Because of the pocket shape, it can be (and most commonly) used to craft a sandwich, you crack it open, stuff whatever you feel like inside, and you've got a neat, portable, and easy to eat sandwich.
Check out <Link to="/recipes/home-made-falafel">our home made falafel</Link> for the ultimate pita sandwich idea.
The sandwich, the most common use of this bread is not the only option though, many pita lovers also love to use it in a less constructed way, they just tear of a piece of it and dip it in a dip like <Link to="/recipes/the-ultimate-hummus-protein-bomb">hummus</Link> or a sauce like <Link to="/recipes/green-chili-sauce">our green chili sauce</Link> or even a soup.
It doesn't matter how you use it, there are no rules, the fresh pita bread is simple, tasty, and a bread option which is normally without a doubt VEGAN.
