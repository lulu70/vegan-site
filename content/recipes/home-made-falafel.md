instructions:
  - items:
      - Pour the chickpeas into a large bowl and cover them with water, let them soak overnight.
      - Drain and rinse the chickpeas, place them into a food processor.
      - Place all rest of the ingredients (exclude the oil, we're going to use it only for frying) into the food processor.
      - Process all the ingredients together until the mixture reaches a texture that looks like tabbouleh salad or couscous, do not over-process it, we want to end up with small chunks and not a paste.
      - Cover the bowl and let it rest for 15 minutes.
      - Grab a bit of the mixture with a big tablespoon and form a ball-shaped using your hands, set it aside, and repeat as many times you fancy.
      - Pour the oil into a small frying pan so it will be deep enough to cover the balls you prepared, heat until it reaches a high temperature that is enough for frying, you can throw in a small amount of the falafel mix inside if it is bubbling you are ready to go.
      - Drop the balls (a few at a time, depending on the size of the pan) in the oil and turn the heat down, it should still bubble but a bit less aggressive than the beginning, fry for around five minutes.
      - When the balls look ready, place them on a sheet of paper towels and eat right away.
