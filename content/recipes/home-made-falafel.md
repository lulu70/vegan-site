> 30 balls

## Ingredients

- 2.5 cups of dry chickpeas
- 1 onion
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1/4 cup of chopped fresh parsley
- 1/2 cup of chopped fresh coriander
- 1 tsp of baking powder
- 1.5 tsp of salt
- 2 tsp of cumin
- 1 tsp of black pepper
- 0.5 tsp of chili pepper powder or chips
- 1.5 tsp of coriander seeds
- vegetable oil for frying

## Instructions

1. Pour the chickpeas into a large bowl and cover them with water, let them soak overnight.
2. Drain and rinse the chickpeas, place them into a food processor.
3. Place all rest of the ingredients ( exclude the oil, we're going to use it only for frying ) into the food processor.

4. Process all the ingredients together until the mixture reaches a texture that looks like tabouli salad or couscous, do not over-process it, we want to end up with small chunks and not a paste.

5. Cover the bowl and let it rest for 15 minutes.   ￼
6. Grab a bit of the mixture with a big tablespoon and form a ball-shaped using your hands, set it aside, and repeat as many times you fancy.
7. Pour the oil into a small frying pan so it will be deep enough to cover the balls you prepared, heat until it reaches a high temperature that is enough for frying, you can throw in a really small amount of the falafel mix inside if it is bubbling you are ready to go.
8. Throw the balls (a few at a time, depending on the size of the pan) in the oil and turn the heat down, it should still bubble but a bit less aggressive than the beginning, fry for around five minutes.
