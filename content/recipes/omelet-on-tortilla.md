## What is chickpea flour?

**Chickpea flour, also known as gram flour or besan is a flour made from dry chickpeas, also known as garbanzo beans.**
Lately, this amazing ingredient is getting more and more popular in the vegan community thanks to the ability to create great new dishes with it, that can (like in this instance) substituted the use of eggs for savory dishes.
If you take a look at where chickpea flour is normally used you can find it in many places like India, Pakistan, Italy, France, Spain, Greece, Morocco, Ethiopia, and the list goes on and on. Each place in this list provides his own version of how to use chickpea flour, they are all great, mostly vegan, or can be easily veganized.

### The chickpeas

The chickpeas are legumes that are high in protein and fiber as well as several minerals and B vitamins.
It is the main ingredient in <Link to="/recipes/the-ultimate-hummus-protein-bomb">Hummus</Link> and it is widely used all over the globe. Some might say they are highly addictive, I agree.

With 356 calories per cup of flour (this recipe uses Â¼ of a cup per serving), there is 21g of protein, 10g of fiber, 53g of carbs and 6g of fat.

## The vegan omelet

Omelet is a dish that is normally made with beaten eggs, fried in a frying pan, and kept in the shape of the pan, usually a circle shape. For many people, it is considered the basic breakfast and there are many varieties to it.
For vegan option omelet, I came across many versions, using all kinds of ingredients like lentils flour, tofu, silken tofu, and of course _the chickpea flour_, lately, new companies are popping up with vegan egg replacements that are ready to use products, these can also be used for a vegan omelet, a good example is <ExternalLink to="https://www.ju.st/en-us/products/consumer/egg/egg">JUST</ExternalLink>.

## The vegan omelet on tortilla

This recipe idea uses a small tortilla as a base that the omelet lies on. The tortilla is placed on top of the mixture liquid and after a few minutes of frying, it gets stuck on top which allows us to flip it over nicely and get a nice and solid dish.

### What is a tortilla?

A tortilla is a type of thin flatbread, typically made from corn or wheat.
It is commonly used in Mexican cuisine and it is used in famous dishes like the taco and burrito.

### How to make the omelet without sticking to the pan?

The real challenge of this recipe is to prevent the omelet from sticking to the pan.
This vegan version of an omelet is maybe a bit more tricky than a normal omelet.
There are two things you can do to make sure you'll end up with a non-sticky result.

1. use the right amount of oil - the oiled pan will help a lot to prevent the stickiness, use the amount noted in the recipe, and if it's not enough, you can add some more next time.
2. use a <ExternalLink to="https://www.amazon.com/GreenPan-Mini-Ceramic-Non-Stick-Round/dp/B015Y20MVK/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1KF13M0G6G9M1&dchild=1&keywords=6+inch+ceramic+egg+pan+nonstick&qid=1591529534&sprefix=6+inch+nonstick+ceramic+%2Caps%2C224&sr=8-2">non-stick pan.</ExternalLink>
   The best way to make sure we're getting a good result is to use a non-stick ceramic pan, it makes it so easy and the results are beautiful.

### Suggestions for other toppings

I love this recipe because it is so simple and has only one topping, the red peppers.

1. onion
2. mushrooms
3. fresh parsley
4. fresh coriander
5. vegan cheese
6. olives
