As a person who grew up in the center of Israel in a city between Jaffa and Ramla, I spent a lot of time in Hummus restaurants with family and friends. \
Hummus stimulates serotonin in the brain and fills us with a pleasant and happy feeling. \
The Israeli cuisine, which is composed of Jewish kitchens from all over the world, lovingly embraced the finest Israeli-Arab's hummus. \
It didn't take too long for me to realize that I must know how to make delicious hummus at home. \
Over the years in any opportunity I collected tips for improving the recipe, and finally I came up with a simple and perfect recipe. \
I am happy to share the recipe with you because to me hummus is joy, hummus is love and harmony. \
Hummus is Vegan!

Drain and rinse the chickpeas, place it in a pot and cover with fresh water. \
Cut the onion to big portions and add it with the garlic cloves to the pot. \
Place the pot on the stove and let it boil with lead half covered. \
When it boils, lower the stove to its low heat and continue the cook for 1Â½ hours with lead fully covered.  \
When its done, check if the chickpeas are ready, it should be very soft.

Use a strainer to filter the contents of the pot and keep the cooking stock  in a separate bowl, we will use it soon.\
Now letâ€™s place our filtered ingredients in a strong food processor, but keep Â½ cup of the chickpeas separate for topping later.

add the salt, cumin, black pepper and tahini to it. Add the lemon juice too. \
Now we will use the stock we kept before, we will start adding 1/2 cup to it and turn the food processor on. The blend should get creamy, smooth, but not too liquid. continue to add small amounts of the stock water to get your desired mash results.
