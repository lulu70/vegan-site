## What is Hummus?
Hummus is a Middle Eastern creamy thick spread made mainly from mashed cooked garbanzo beans (chickpeas) and a few other ingredients as tahini, garlic, lemon juice, olive oil.
## The beans
 Garbanzo beans are one of the earliest known cultivated legumes. We also know them as chickpea seeds. They are high in protein. The chickpea is frequently used in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisine. Chickpeas' low water demand is one of the lowest. they also have deep root systems that prevent their drift. Their leaves are naturally insecticidal leaves. All this makes them a sustainable crop.

## The origin of hummus
Hummus is an ‚Äúancient‚Äù food that was first consumed in Egypt around the 13th century. 
There are many stories about hummus consuming by important leaders in the history of the middle east. Islamic traditions claim that it was Saladin who invented the hummus as it is served today, minced chickpeas with tahini.

## What is tahini?
Tahini is a sesame seed paste, made from roasted ground sesame seeds.  It is used mainly in traditional Middle Eastern foods and Asian cuisine.
The oldest mention of sesame is in a cuneiform document written 4000 years ago, it described as ‚Äúthe gods sesame wine‚Äù.

## The process
Making hummus is simple and easy and requires just 3 main steps:
Soaking, cooking and grinding.
Hummus is usually served with <Link to="/recipes/vegan-home-made-pita-bread">pita bread,</Link> but its also used as a dip or a paste in sandwiches and wraps.
It became so popular and you can find it almost in any supermarket,
But the best hummus is a fresh hummus that was grounded minutes before and is still hot as you eat it.

## The feeling
The chickpeas contain "tryptophan", an amino acid that is responsible for, among other things, good feeling, uplifting mood and stress relaxation. 
The humus is high in fiber and therefore gives a feeling of satiety that can last for a long time. It has few calories in relation to the satiety it provides and high-quality proteins.
