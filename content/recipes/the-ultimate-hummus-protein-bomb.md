As a person who grew up in the center of Israel in a city between Jaffa and Ramla, I spent a lot of time in hummus restaurants with family and friends. Hummus stimulates serotonin in the brain and fills us with a pleasant and happy feeling. The israeli cuisine, which is composed of jewish kitchens from all over the world, lovingly embraced the finest israeli-arab's hummus.
It didn't take too long for me to realize that I must know how to make delicious hummus at home.
Over the years in any opportunity, I collected tips for improving the recipe, and finally, I came up with a simple and perfect recipe.
I am happy to share the recipe with you because to me hummus is joy, hummus is love and harmony.
hummus is Vegan!
