## A gift from africa

When traveling around the globe and attending food and music festivals, I was amazed to discover this amazingly simple dish that can be easily made completely vegan.
It is a traditional senegalese stew usually made with meat, based on tomato sauce and peanut butter.
To make it vegan all I did is added soy chunks that can be found anywhere, nice and easy.
The result is so nice tasty and creamy that you wouldn't believe it.

## The peanut butter

The main ingredient of this dish is the peanut butter.
For this, I used a natural, 100% peanuts peanut butter that is creamy and full of taste out of the box.
I really recommend to try and find one, and if you don't, you can always just make it yourself.

## Side suggestion - a little taste of the east

For side, for a dish like this one, the normal go-to for me is white rice.
For this occasion, I wanted to add something else to make it a bit more special.
I decided to add vegan cheese spread, inspired by the Ethiopian cuisine.
