> 8 portions

## Ingredients

- 4 cups of all-purpose flour
- 1.5 tsp of active dry yeast
- 1 tbsp of sugar
- 2.5 tbsp of olive oil
- 1.5 tsp of salt
- 1.5 cups of water

## Instructions

1. Mix the yeast with half a cup room temperature water in a glass.
2. Place the flour, the yeast, the sugar, and the oil into a bowl, (if you have a standing mixer you can place it in the working bowl) and knead for five minutes.
3. Add the salt and knead for like ten minutes until you get a beautiful stable piece of dough, add water gradually and carefully.
4. Place a cloth or a towel on top of the bowl and let it rest for an hour.
5. Take the dough out of the bowl, place onto a floured workspace, and form a long round shape (like a shape of a normal loaf of bread).

6. Cut eight even pieces and form each piece into a small round ball with a smooth top, pulling dough from the sides and tucking the ends underneath the bottom.
7. Place a cloth or a towel on top of the balls and let them rest for 15 minutes.
8. On a floured workspace gently pat each ball flat using your hand and form a round pita shape using a rolling pin - the thickness should be around 6mm, 1/4 inch.
