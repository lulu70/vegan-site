Lately I came across a situation with an <a target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-TV-32GB-4th-generation/dp/B075NFX24M">Apple TV</a>,
I was trying to connect it to my tv screen,
but I also wanted to connect it to my audio system, the problem was that it only has one HDMI port üòè.
So I was thinking: _How do I get audio out of HDMI?_

**Apparently there are a few situations that you might find yourself trying to connect your device to an audio system and it only has one HDMI port available. In order to achieve this you will need to extract the audio out of the HDMI. I did some research and found out that extracting the audio from an HDMI only device can be achieved with a very simple and inexpensive device, lets have a look at the problem, when you might have to think about it, and the ways to solve it and get that audio out of HDMI.**

## What is HDMI

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI" target="_blank">
  HDMI On Wikipedia
</a>

> HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) is a proprietary audio/video interface for transmitting uncompressed video data and compressed or uncompressed digital audio data from an HDMI-compliant source device, such as a display controller, to a compatible computer monitor, video projector, digital television, or digital audio device.[4] HDMI is a digital replacement for analog video standards.

## Why Do I have to get audio out of HDMI ?

An HDMI cable can carry all the video **and audio** that you need, but what happens if you need to get connected to a different audio system?
Many devices these days ships with just an HDMI output. For example this one: <a target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-TV-32GB-4th-generation/dp/B075NFX24M">Apple TV</a> or this one: <a target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-GA3A00403A14-Chromecast-Ultra/dp/B0157OY5EA/ref=sr_1_4?crid=RAY82VUKAWHT&keywords=cromecast+tv&qid=1579872011&sprefix=cromecast%2Caps%2C216&sr=8-4">Google Chromecast Ultra</a>.
The assumption with these devices is that the user will connect it to his tv screen that has build in speakers.
That will workout just fine and it is also a very elegant solution, just one cable that can do all you need.  
But what if you want something better? what if the build in speakers are just not enough and you need more volume or better quality? or what if you just want to use a projector???
Where will the audio go then? Unfortunately the answer is : _NOWHERE_.

## What if I‚Äôm using my computer?

If you are using your own computer you most certainly have a designated audio output so you definitely can connect your HDMI cable to your screen and your audio separately to the audio system. Sometimes your computer will not cooperate though, because it will detect that an HDMI cable has been connected, the computer will automatically set the default system sound to go out throw the HDMI port, in that you will have to explicitly set the default system audio to go out throw the other audio output.

## What are HDMI audio extractors?

An HDMI audio extractor is a device that allows you to extract audio signals from an HDMI source.

## How do HDMI audio extractors will get the audio out of HDMI?

These devices will have an input port of HDMI that you can connect to and a different output options.
In the output section they will have, depending on the model, some kind of standard audio output port that will provide the extracted audio from the HDMI input.
It is that simpleüòÉ.
