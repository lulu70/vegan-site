## Why do I need it?

An HDMI cable can carry all the <strong>video and audio</strong> that you need, but what happens if you need to get connected to a different audio system?
Many devices these days ships with just an HDMI output. For example this one: <a target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-TV-32GB-4th-generation/dp/B075NFX24M">Apple TV</a> or this one: <a target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-GA3A00403A14-Chromecast-Ultra/dp/B0157OY5EA/ref=sr_1_4?crid=RAY82VUKAWHT&keywords=cromecast+tv&qid=1579872011&sprefix=cromecast%2Caps%2C216&sr=8-4">Google Chromecast Ultra</a>.
The assumption with these devices is that the buyer will connect it to his tv screen that has build in speakers.
But what if you want something better, what if the build in speakers are just not enough and you need more volume, or what if you just want to use a projector???
Where will the audio go then? Unfortunately the answer is : <strong>NOWHERE</strong>.
