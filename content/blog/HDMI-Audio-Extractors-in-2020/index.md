## What is it ? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

An HDMI audio extractor is that device that allows you to extract audio signals from an HDMI source.

## Why do I need it?

An HDMI cable can carry all the video <strong>and audio</strong> you need, but what happens if you need to get connected to a different audio system?
Many times when you arranging any kind of event for more then 10 poeple for example you realise that you need more audio volume then the crappy TV screen speakers you have.
Yes, you need a more powerfull sound system, but all you have is a device that has only an HDMI output like the <a target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-TV-32GB-4th-generation/dp/B075NFX24M">Apple TV</a>.

way. On her way she met a copy.

But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn‚Äôt take long until a
few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with

rewritten, then they are still using her.

#### Silent delightfully including because before one up barring chameleon

Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a
