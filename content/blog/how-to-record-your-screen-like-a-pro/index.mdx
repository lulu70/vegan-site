## What is a screen recording?

A screen recording is the act of recording your entire screen or a selected part of it.

When you make a screen recording you are creating a video file that will show exactly what you saw on screen while you were recording, much like audio recording will create an audio file that you can listen too after.

After the recording file is ready you will be able to play it anytime you want, share it to your friends, or maybe... put it on youtube and become famous, its there to stay, you made a tiny piece of history.

In edition to _'recording what you are seeing'_ you are also recording your interaction, the viewer will be able to see your mouse or trackpad curser, and because of this the movement will be recorded too, pretty awesome ðŸ˜€.

## Why people record their screen ?

Well, in this day and age there are many reasons why someone will look into screen recording.

When you record your screen you can show the exact interaction you have with your computer. Lets say you are using a program and you want to teach others how to do it themselves, lets say you want to record a website to show the user experience it provides,
there are many scenarios why someone will choose to record their screen but the main idea is the ability to capture exactly what happened with you and the computer in a way that only video can.

Lets have a look at an example:
Imagine you want to create a resource for others explaining how to use Excel spreadsheets for their taxes use.
You can write all your instructions trying to explain all the necessary functions that can be achieved, it can become a very good resource that can help many people, now imagine you also add a video, one that show you while you are using all these functions,
at that point you are adding a huge value, videos are great to learn from, specially videos that have been made to teach.

> In edition to _'recording what you are seeing'_ you are also recording your interaction.

In edition to making a full width videos showing a screen recording, when you learn the basic of screen recording you will be able to also make short clips that can be added to a longer video, support clips, that show exactly what you are talking about, for example:
You trying to talk about the amount of restaurants in a specific area, why not show a short video of you searching this area on google maps (using your computer) and show actually the result of the search, it makes it way more real and again it add a value that only video can add.
