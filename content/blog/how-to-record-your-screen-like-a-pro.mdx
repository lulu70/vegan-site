Many online pro content makers out there choose to have screen recordings as part or as the main part of their videos, how can you record your screen? and more importantly how to do it like a pro?

**Recording your screen like a pro can be achieved by using a free built-in software in your operating system or by using external software. Some of the software options will give you the basic good solution that you are looking for, and some will have nice added features that will give your recording the _magic pro touch_. In this post I will try to explain what I've learned trying to record my screen, what are the reasons to record your screen, and how to do it in a PRO way.**

## What is a screen recording?

A screen recording is an act of recording your entire screen or a selected portion of it.

When you make a screen recording you are creating a video file that will show exactly what you saw on the screen while you were recording, much like audio recording will create an audio file that you can listen too after, or like a video camera that will create a video file with everything in front of the lens.

In edition to _'recording what you are seeing'_ you are also recording your interaction, the viewer will be able to see your mouse or trackpad curser, and because of this, the movement will be recorded too, pretty awesome üòÄ.

After the recording file is ready you will be able to play it anytime you want, share it to your friends, or maybe... put it on youtube and become famous, its there to stay, you made a tiny piece of history.

## Why people record their screen?

Well, in this day and age there are many reasons why someone will look into screen recording.

When you record your screen you can show the exact interaction you have with your computer. Let's say you are using a program and you want to teach others how to do it themselves, let's say you want to record a website to show the user experience it provides,
there are many scenarios why someone will choose to record their screen but the main idea is the ability to capture exactly what happened with you and the computer in a way that only video can.

Let's have a look at an example:
Imagine you want to create a resource for others explaining how to use Excel spreadsheets for their tax use.
You can write all your instructions trying to explain all the necessary functions that can be used, it can become a very good resource that can help many people, now imagine you also add a video, one that shows you while you are using all these functions,
at that point you are adding a huge value, videos are great to learn from, especially videos that have been made to teach.

> In edition to _'recording what you are seeing'_ you are also recording your interaction, the viewer will be able to see your mouse or trackpad curser, and because of this, the movement will be recorded too, pretty awesome üòÄ.

In addition to making full-width videos showing a screen recording, when you learn the basic of screen recording you will be able to also make short clips that can be added to a longer video, support clips, that show exactly what you are talking about, for example:
You trying to talk about the number of restaurants in a specific area, why not show a short video of you searching this area on google maps (using your computer) and show the actual result of the search, it makes it way more real and understandable and again it adds a value that only a video can add.

## How can you do it?

The ways to record your screen are different depending on the operating system that your computer runs.
In this post I will try to cover the most common options.

### Recording your screen on a mac using QuickTime Player:

QuickTime Player is a software that ships together with every mac. It's a video player that has some extra killer features.
To start recording your screen fire up QuickTime and choose: `File > New Screen Recording`. At that point there are some settings to be made :

- Choose rather full-screen recording or a recording of specific portion of the screen.
- Choose the location on your computer where you want the final file to be saved to.
- Choose if you want to have a timer before the recording starts.
- Choose your microphone input: you can choose your built-in microphone or another audio input that you might have connected.
- You can also choose `show mouse clicks` to show a nice circle around the mouse curser to show your clicks in the video.

`You can find these settings in the tools menu that should appear (the image on the left), or in a popup menu (the image on the right) depending on the macOS version.`

There is also an option using QuickTime to make another recording of yourself using the built-in camera or another connected camera at the same time.
This option is very useful if you are making a video with the screen recording and you talk about it at the same time. Later you can use the two recordings and edit them to one video using a video editing software.
To start a camera recording choose: `File > New Movie Recording`, they both can run simultaneously.

After you start your recording you will find a new stop icon on your menubar ‚èπ, when you press it the recording will stop and your file will soon be ready.
