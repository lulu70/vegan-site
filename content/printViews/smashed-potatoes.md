### Ingredients

- 8 potatoes
- ¼ a cup of olive oil
- 2 garlic cloves
- 3 tbsp of fresh thyme
- ½ tsp of chili pepper powder or flakes
- salt, to taste
- black pepper, to taste

### Let's start

1. Wash and clean the potatoes very well, remove any dirty spots if there's are any, we're not going to peel them, so make sure they are clean.
2. Place them into a cooking pot with boiled water and cook until they are soft, about 30 minutes depending on the size of the potatoes.
3. Mince the garlic.
4. Place the olive oil, garlic, thyme, chilly pepper, salt, and pepper into a bowl and mix everything together.
5. Prepare a baking tray with baking paper, and oil it a bit using some olive oil.
6. Place the boiled potatoes on the tray and gently smash each one of them separately using a hand potato masher, be careful not to break them apart.
7. Drizzle evenly all the spiced oil mixture that you made before on the potatoes.
8. Preheat the oven to 220℃.
9. Bake the potatoes for about 30 minutes until they look nice and crispy.<br/>
enjoy!
