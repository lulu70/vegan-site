3. Add the water to the mixture and mix everything.
4. Add the mustard and mix it with the rest.
5. Pour the oil into a 15 cm **non-stick** frying pan, (the non-stick part is necessary, otherwise it will be tricky to flip it over).
6. Fry the red pepper strips for 5 minutes.
7. Pour the omelet mixture in and fry for 5 minutes.
8. Place a tortilla on top of the omelet and continue frying for 3 more minutes.
