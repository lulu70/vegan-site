### Let's start

1. Put chickpeas into a large bowl, add the baking soda powder and water to cover the chickpeas, let them soak overnight for a minimum of 12 hours.
2. Drain and rinse the chickpeas, place it in a pot and fill in fresh water to cover the chickpeas.
3. Cut the onion to big portions and add it with the garlic cloves to the pot. place the pot on the stove and let it boil with lid half covered.
4. When it boils, lower the stove to a low heat and continue the cook for 1Â½ hours with lid fully covered.
5. Take the pot out of the fire and check if the chickpeas are ready, they should be very soft.
6. Use a strainer to filter the contents of the pot and keep the cooking stock in a separate bowl, we will use it soon.
7. Place the filtered ingredients in a strong food processor, but keep Â½ cup of the chickpeas separate for topping later. add also the salt, cumin, black pepper, tahini and lemon juice to it.
8. Use the stock we kept before, start to add Â½ cup of it and turn the food processor on. the blend should become creamy, smooth, but not too liquid. continue to add small amounts of the stock to get your desired mash results.

### For the toppings
