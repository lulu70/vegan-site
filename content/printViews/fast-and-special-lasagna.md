3. Choose a large pan or a wok and heat the oil in it.
4. Cut the onions, carrots and the celery to dices and fry it 3-5 minutes until its golden.
5. Cut the zucchini, mushrooms, and dry tomatoes to dices and add it and the minced garlic to the pan. continue to fry for another 5 minutes.
6. Now chop the tomatoes to dices or use a canned version and add it to the pan.
7. Add the tomato puree, salt, pepper, oregano, thyme, rosemary and basil to the pan and stir.
8. Add the vegetable broth and the red wine to the pan, stir and cook it covered for another 10-15 minutes.
9. Meanwhile, rinse and drain the cashew and place it in a food processor.
   add the oat milk, lemon juice and all the bechamel spices to it and blend 1-2 minutes to get a creamy texture.
   if it's too thick add more oat milk.
10. Take the pan off the stove and get ready to start the layers art.
11. In a casserole dish, 25/35cm (+/-), sprinkle olive oil and pour the first layer of the vegetables sauce.
    try to flat it to a thickness of 1 cm and cover it with a layer of pasta sheets.
    now cover the pasta sheets with a layer of the bechamel we made, try to get a ½ cm layer.
12. Repeat it again and again at least 2 more sets of layers.
13. For the last layer we want to cover the pasta sheets completely with the vegetable sauce. this way they will get soft and not dry hard in the oven.
    on top, we will spread the nutritional yeast equally and finally place the dish in the oven.
14. Bake for 45 minutes and check with a knife if the pasta sheets are soft enough, if not, you can cover it with aluminum foil and bake for another 10 minutes.
When it's ready, take it out of the oven and let it cool down before serving.<br/>
