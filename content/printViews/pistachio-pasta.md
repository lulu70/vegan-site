## Ingredients

- ½ a cup of pistachios without the shells
- ⅓ a cup of olive oil
- 2 garlic cloves
- 4 cups of pasta of choice
- ½ tsp of salt
- ¼ tsp of black pepper

## Let's start

1. Prepare half a cup of pistachios without the shells, you can find them without shells or just separate them yourself.
2. Mince the garlic, fry it on a pan with 1 tbsp of olive oil until it will have a golden color, about five or six minutes.
3. Place the pistachios, the rest of the olive oil, the garlic, the salt and pepper into a blender and blend it until you have a nice sauce texture, not too much, we still want some nice chunks.
4. Cook the pasta "al dente" in a pan and keep the water aside.
5. On a big pan with medium heat, mix the pasta with the pistachio sauce, and add 1/4 a cup of the pasta water, fry everything together for three minutes, enjoy right away.
