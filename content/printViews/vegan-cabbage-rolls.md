### Ingredients

- 1 white cabbage (I used a pointed cabbage)
- 1 tbsp of olive oil
- 1 onion
- 2 celery sticks
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 tomato
- ½ a cup of walnuts
- ¼ a cup of pumpkin seeds
- ¼ a cup of dried cranberries
- 150 gr of fresh parsley
- 150 gr of fresh coriander
- 1 cup of white rice
- 2 lemons
- 1 tsp of red paprika powder
- salt, to taste
- black pepper, to taste

### Let's start

1. Cut out the hard center core of the cabbage in a cone shape using a knife, and remove it using your hands.
2. Place the cabbage into a pan with boiling water filled until about half the height of the cabbage, cook for 20 minutes, take it out of the pan, and set aside.
3. Place the walnuts and pumpkin seeds into a food processor and pulse it a few times until you have small chunks, (be careful not to grind them completely).
4. Chop the onion, garlic, celery, tomato, parsley, and coriander, set aside.
5. Heat the olive oil in a frying pan and start with frying the onion for a few minutes until there is a bit of color change, add the garlic and celery, fry for three more minutes.
6. Add the chopped tomato, the nuts mixture, the dried cranberries, and the herbs, fry for two minutes.
7. Shut down the heat and add the rice (wash the rice first).
8. Add the paprika powder, salt, and pepper, mix it all.
9. Gently separate the cabbage leaves one at a time, place some filling in each leaf, roll it, and place it in a cooking pan, repeat the process for each leaf.
10. Squeeze the lemons and add some salt and pepper to the juice, pour it on top of the rolls, and add boiling water till it covers almost all of them.
11. Cook it on small heat for about an hour.
